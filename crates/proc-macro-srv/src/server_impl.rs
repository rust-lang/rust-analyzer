//! proc-macro server implementation
//!
//! Based on idea from <https://github.com/fedochet/rust-proc-macro-expander>
//! The lib-proc-macro server backend is `TokenStream`-agnostic, such that
//! we could provide any TokenStream implementation.
//! The original idea from fedochet is using proc-macro2 as backend,
//! we use tt instead for better integration with RA.
